That&#039;s not really anything to be surprised about any more most UX&#039;ers sketch nowadays in the early stages of a project.<br />Sometimes a page goes through 10-20 iterations. I try not to think about structure at first and just sketch let the ideas flow it&#039;s kind of using my hand as my brain. It&#039;s done it lots of times before so it knows what to do and I trust it. I have come up with (almost by accident) an copied lots of different styles for drawing things. Boxes, headings, links, drop-downs, overlays.<br /> At times a wireframe will just be a series of lines and I show this to the people I&#039;m working with. I often wonder if the people I&#039;m showing sketches to understand what they are looking at. It&#039;s very hard to talk about ideas such as &quot;when you click this it transforms in to this&quot; if you don&#039;t have this shared understanding. For this reason I thought I would document my visual vocabulary. There really isn&#039;t a lot it its a few elements that I use over and over again. Here they are not very sophisticated but they work for me.<br /> I have tried slightly higher fidelity versions using color to pick out links (blue), errors (red) and success (green) but it always feel like I&#039;m getting in to the territory of marker visuals when I do this and that&#039;s not a sketch If I want to do something like that I&#039;ll jump in to InDesign, Illustrator, Omnigraffle or whatever other app I feel like using that day. <p /> Oh and if your keen to know how I&#039;m getting on in my resolutions just look at the date of this post. Not exactly what I was planning but better late than never.<br /></p>        </div>
