<blockquote>As designers, we pride ourselves on being great communicators. We go to extreme lengths to communicate with users in a language they understand, enabling them to engage with our messages and feel like they’re part of a story we built just for them. Yet, we do a poor job of communicating with those whom our work requires us to talk to every day—and we need to, and can, get better at it.</blockquote>

<p>That's the second post that I've saved today about communicating and getting better at it. As an industry I really believe that we need to be excellent communicators.
For design to truly make a difference and fulfil its potential as an agent for change. Collectively we need to work hard to communicate with the non-designers we work with.</p>
