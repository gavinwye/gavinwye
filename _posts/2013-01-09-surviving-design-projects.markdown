<a href="http://blog.greenonions.com/">Dan Brown</a> has put together a great set of patterns for surviving design projects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surviving Design Projects is a collection of lessons learned over the last 15 years on how to deal with conflict on projects. I’m rendering the lessons as “patterns” — a tool used by designers to establish a starting point for solving a problem. Patterns are, by definition, incomplete, but they give designers a framework for addressing design challenges. Likewise, these patterns give team members ways to manage conflict.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure I'd call them patterns more techniques. But who cares what you call them as long as they help.</p>
