Initially I got in to "Web Design" because I thought I could make a shit load of money. Based on a chance meeting with an old school friend who was earning 35K strait out of university. That never happened! But what did happen was the realisation that there needs to be something else, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html">this is nothing new</a>. If you know why you are doing something then it all becomes a lot easier. Call it purpose if you like?



Over the years I've always had a sense of purpose in the work that I have done, but it's taken me a good few years to understand personally what this purpose is. And I've only recently been able to articulate it in a way I feel comfortable with.



My sense of purpose, the thing that keeps me coming back for more every day even when I have had a bad day is the fact that. I Want to help people. I want to make the web a better place. Now I admit that I copied <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a> or at least was inspired by them. The strap line Doing good is part of our code rings true with me. Yea I know I'm a bit of a hippie. It feels right to me, and good enough for the time being I'm sure that I'll revisit this again in the future. But right now it's the best I've got.



So, the only question I now have is. Can you be a User Experience Designer if you don't share this vision? A friend once said to me about User Experience.

  I think in the end we will all just admit that it's good for business.

Yes it is, what better thing for a business could there be than making it easy for your customers to do business with you in whatever way they want?



So what got you started?
