<p>The IxDA have just announced their new speaker network. I'm seeing the rise of things like this lately. That's a good thing IMHO if you know stuff you should make an effort to share it with other people.</p>

<blockquote>
  The goal of the speaker network is to not only allow groups with more access to speakers to share opportunities with other groups, but to give everyone a chance to speak on what is passionate to them. Many may not consider themselves speakers, but have great stories to tell, and we want to hear them.


  
  A link to the speaker network is accessible via IxDA.org within both the local and about areas. The direct link to the form is http://tiny.cc/IxDASpeakers.


  
  I'd like to encourage everyone to add themselves to the database as well as spreading the word to those you know that have stories to share.</blockquote>
