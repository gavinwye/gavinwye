  <p>"Ideas are valuable.  They deserve a better home than a post-it note.  Artefact cards have been designed to offer a better way to craft, refine and reorder ideas. "</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could use these as you go through a project or series of workshops. As you define things like design principles it would be good for everyone to be able to walk away with a deck of cards that summarise, all decisions that have been made to date.</p>

<p>I wonder how stakeholders would react to that?</p>
