<p>There has been a lot of talk and comment about the new iOS interface introduced earlier this week LINK. I think it looks great, possibly a little rough round the edges and a few icons - such as notes and todo's - which could, in my opinion benefit from a bit of attention. But those problems are easily solved and I'm sure they will be before it's launched next month.</p>

<p>However I think we are missing the interesting thing. We now have a Product Designer leading the Graphic Design of a product. The Graphic Design and Product Design are becoming one.</p>
