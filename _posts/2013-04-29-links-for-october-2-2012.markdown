> on the programme we talk about the of website audio capchas. These are the anti-spam devices used by companies that we're confronted with when buying tickets, booking flights or signing up for services.

Nice to see CAPTCH's getting some mainstream coverage and being addressed from an accessibility point of view. There are some nice solutions suggested for alternatives. However they dont mention things like the honey pot.

Listening to the part of the show where they talk about the CAPTCHA really brings home the point that it's not accessible. I for one remember being sat in meetings where we have listened to it and dismissively said oh well.</li></ol>
