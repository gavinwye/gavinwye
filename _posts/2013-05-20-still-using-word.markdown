<p>It puzzels me that in an industry such as this - the web design industry - there are so many people who produce documents that get circulated as PDF's, Excel spreadsheets and Word documents.</p>

<p>It's a lot easier to distribute if you publish you're project documents online. If it's part of a project, the easiest thing for all people involved is to have a dedicated site set up <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/the-most-awesome-wordpress-theme-you-probably-dont-know-about-p2/">Wordpress and P2</a> works well. There are other far better ways to work collaboratively. Emailing documents and storing them on a server where they get lost and out of date is IMHO not the best way.</p>

<p>If you care about the work that you are doing you need to publish it where as many people as possible will have exposure to it.</p>
